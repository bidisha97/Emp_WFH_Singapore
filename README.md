# Emp_WFH_Singapore
A case study on employee attitudes towards work from home culture in Singapore.
For making this dashboard, I used the data visualisation tool 'Tableau'. 
This study is based on the peak time of Covid, where the mode of work changed into work from home. 
It was interesting to find that older age group where quite comfortable with the new change.
According to the data, it was predicted that social distancing can go up to a year.
It can be said from the bar charts that working hours and stress had increased during this time.
